Reinforced FDM by Multi-Axis 3D Printing


I would like to check if your website interests about reporting our recent breakthrough published in a newly accepted SIGGRAPH Asia 2020 paper. This is a joint project conducted in my research group (The University of Manchester, UK) and collaborated with the research group of Dr.Zichun Zhong (Wayne State University, U.S.A). 

This research project is an extended development of the project, Multi-Axis Robotic 3D Printing, which reported by your website two years ago. (https://3dprint.com/215803/multi-axis-robotic-3d-printer/)

Details of the newly accepted paper are:

Guoxin Fang, Tianyu Zhang, Sikai Zhong, Xiangjia Chen, Zichun Zhong, and Charlie C.L. Wang, "Reinforced FDM: multi-axis filament alignment with controlled anisotropic strength", ACM Transaction on Graphics (SIGGRAPH Asia 2020), accepted.

Co-Authors:
Guoxin Fang, Tianyu Zhang and Xiangjia Chen are PhD students supervised by me at TU Delft / CUHK before I move to University of Manchester in this Summer. 
Sikai Zhong is a PhD student supervised by Dr.Zhong at Wayne State University.


Thanks for your consideration.

Best Regards,
Charlie
