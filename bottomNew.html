Charlie C. L. Wang is a Chair Professor of Smart Manufacturing at the University of Manchester (UoM). Before joining UoM in 2020, he previously worked as a Professor and Chair of Advanced Manufacturing at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands (2016) and as a Professor (2015) / Associate Professor (2009) / Assistant Professor (2003) of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
He also held a visiting professor position at University of Southern California during his sabbatical leave (2011). He received his B.Eng. degree (1998) in mechatronics engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and his Ph.D. degree (2002) in mechanical engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prof. Wang was the recipient of several awards, including the ASME CIE Excellence in Research Award (2016), the ASME CIE Young Engineer Award (2009), seven Best Paper Awards, five project-oriented technology innovation awards and three teaching awards. He was named a Fellow of American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 2013, and is currently chairing the executive committee of Solid Modeling Association (SMA).
