<b>What is Thickening?</b></a><br><br>

Thickening is a library written in C++, which provides the algorithm for computing the offsetting solids of mesh models. When the input is an open surface, the skinned solid with a user-specified thickness will be generated with the help of distance-field [1]. While a uniformly hollowed solid will be generated if the input is a model with closed surface. This algorithm is actually a deviation of our earlier work for uniform offsetting a mesh model - also based on signed distance-field [2]. <br><br>

The implementation of this algorithm is based on a complex-based mesh data structure and basic operators that are introduced in [3]. The efficient distance evaluation for query points is based on the PQP library [4] of UNC, and Dr. Shengjun Liu modified it to be able to return not only the closest point to a query but only the triangle containing this closet point when developing the work in [2].
